      Network security is a critical concern in today's interconnected world,
      where cyber threats are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly
      sophisticated. Traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems
      (IDS) rely on predefined rules and patterns to identify known threats, but
      they often struggle to detect novel or zero-day attacks. This project aims
      to develop a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that leverages the
      power of Machine Learning (ML) to overcome the limitations of conventional
      approaches. By employing advanced ML algorithms and techniques, this NIDS
      is designed to analyze network traffic patterns, identify anomalies, and
      detect potential intrusions or malicious activities in real-time. The
      proposed system has the potential to significantly enhance network
      security posture, providing a robust and adaptable solution capable of
      keeping pace with the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats.

      This project focuses on developing a Network Intrusion Detection System
      (NIDS) that employs Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect and
      mitigate cyber threats in real-time. The system is designed to
      continuously monitor network traffic and analyze it for potential
      anomalies or malicious activities. By leveraging advanced ML algorithms,
      such as deep neural networks, the NIDS can learn from historical data and
      adapt to new patterns, enabling it to detect both known and unknown
      threats effectively. The project involves collecting and preprocessing
      network traffic data, exploring and evaluating various ML models, training
      and optimizing the selected models, and integrating them into a
      comprehensive NIDS framework. Additionally, the project explores
      techniques for feature engineering and dimensionality reduction to enhance
      the system's performance and efficiency. The ultimate goal is to develop a
      robust and scalable NIDS that can be deployed in various network
      environments, providing proactive defense against cyber attacks while
      minimizing false positives and negatives.
