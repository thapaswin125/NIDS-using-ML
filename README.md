## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using machine learning algorithms to detect malicious activities within computer networks.  
It analyzes network traffic data and classifies it as **Normal** or **Anomalous**, thereby helping administrators detect unauthorized access, exploits, and cyberattacks.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Detects abnormal behaviors in computer networks  
- Real-time monitoring and classification of network traffic  
- Supports multiple ML classifiers:
  - Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)  
  - Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB)  
- Uses **NSL-KDD dataset** for training & testing  
- Accuracy & misclassification comparison graphs  
- GUI for user-friendly interaction

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
```
Network Packets → Feature Extractor → Feature Selector → Classifier → Alerts
```

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Detect abnormal activities in a computer/network  
- Dynamically monitor real-time events  
- Prevent unauthorized access & privilege escalation  
- Reduce false alarms and improve accuracy  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
We used the **NSL-KDD dataset**, which contains four categories of attacks:  
- **DoS (Denial of Service)** – Overloading system resources  
- **U2R (User to Root)** – Privilege escalation  
- **R2L (Remote to Local)** – Unauthorized remote access  
- **Probing** – Network scanning & vulnerability detection

## 🔑 Implementation Details  
### Preprocessing  
- Scaling (Standardization)  
- Label Encoding  
- Feature Selection (Random Forest, RFE)  

### Model Training Example  
```python
# K-Nearest Neighbor
KNN_Classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_jobs=-1)
KNN_Classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Bernoulli Naive Bayes
BNB_Classifier = BernoulliNB()
BNB_Classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Decision Tree
DTC_Classifier = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=0)
DTC_Classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```

### Prediction  
- Classifies incoming packets as **Normal** or **Anomaly**  

### Evaluation  
- Accuracy comparison between models  
- Confusion matrix & performance visualization

## 📌 Future Scope  
- Extend detection to **HTTP-specific web server attacks**  
- Add **Denial of Service (DoS) detection**  
- Integrate **NIDS + HIDS** for hybrid anomaly detection  
- Improve accuracy using ensemble & deep learning techniques
